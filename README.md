# 80-Days-CSE-Grind
When I started learning to code, everything felt new and confusing. Even simple steps like installing a compiler, configuring GitHub, or fixing input errors in Python took time. Sometimes my laptop froze, sometimes Git gave me errors like ‚Äúnot a git repository‚Äù, and sometimes HackerRank questions seemed too difficult.

But instead of giving up, I kept going.

Day by day, I broke my learning into small pieces. I solved my first HackerRank challenges, learned how to work with arrays in Python, and slowly moved into NumPy, experimenting with array(), shape, and reshape. At first, I struggled even with basic input handling ‚Äî but with practice, I learned how to read errors, fix them, and move on.

Now, I see coding not just as typing commands, but as a way to solve problems, think logically, and grow stronger through mistakes. Every challenge makes me more confident.

This is just the beginning of my journey, but I‚Äôm ready to keep going ‚Äî step by step, day by day. üöÄ
